## Project Structure Creation

The extension provides powerful tools for creating project structures:

### Built-in Templates

Create complete project structures with a few clicks using built-in templates for:

- **Node.js Projects**: Basic Node.js application with package.json and folder structure
- **React Applications**: React app with components, styles, and configuration
- **Python Projects**: Python project with src/tests directories and setup files

### Custom AI-Generated Structures

Describe the project structure you want in natural language, and the AI will generate it for you:

1. Select "AI: Create Project Structure" from the command palette
2. Enter the base path for your project
3. Choose "Custom" as the project type
4. Describe your desired structure (e.g., "A TypeScript project with Express backend and React frontend")
5. The AI will generate a complete project structure based on your description

### File Content Generation

When creating files, you can:
- Create empty files
- Enter content manually
- Have the AI generate content based on your description

The AI will automatically adapt to the file type based on the extension, generating appropriate content for JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and many other file types.

## Code Modification

The extension provides powerful tools for modifying existing code:

### Modifying Files with AI

Easily modify existing files with AI assistance:

1. Run the "AI: Modify File" command from the command palette
2. Select the file to modify (or uses the current file if one is open)
3. Choose how you want to modify the file:
   - **Replace Entire Content**: Manually enter new content
   - **Modify with AI**: Describe the changes you want to make

When using AI to modify files:
1. Enter a description of the changes you want to make
2. The AI analyzes the current file content and applies your requested changes
3. The modified file is opened in the editor for review

### Inserting Code at Cursor Position

Insert code at the current cursor position:

1. Position your cursor where you want to insert code
2. Run the "AI: Insert Code" command from the command palette
3. Choose how you want to insert code:
   - **Enter Code Manually**: Type or paste the code to insert
   - **Generate with AI**: Have the AI generate code based on your description

When generating code with AI:
1. Enter a description of the code you want to insert
2. The AI analyzes the surrounding code for context
3. The generated code is inserted at the cursor position

## Code Testing & Execution

The extension provides tools for testing and executing code directly from the editor:

### Testing Code

Generate and run tests for your code:

1. Select the code you want to test (or the entire file will be used)
2. Run the "AI: Test Code" command from the command palette
3. The AI will:
   - Generate appropriate unit tests for your code
   - Create temporary test files
   - Run the tests in a terminal window
   - Show the test code in a new editor tab

The test generation is language-aware and will use the appropriate testing framework:
- JavaScript: Mocha
- TypeScript: Mocha with ts-node
- Python: unittest
- Ruby: Test::Unit

### Executing Code

Run code directly from the editor:

1. Select the code you want to execute (or the entire file will be used)
2. Run the "AI: Execute Code" command from the command palette
3. The code will be:
   - Saved to a temporary file
   - Executed in a terminal window with the appropriate runtime

Supported languages:
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- TypeScript (ts-node)
- Python
- Ruby
- Shell scripts (Bash)

## Feature Suggestion System

## Privacy & Security

When using local LLMs, your code never leaves your machine. Cloud mode requires an API key and sends code to the configured API endpoint for processing.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.80.0+
- For local mode: A running LLM server
- For cloud mode: API key for your chosen service
